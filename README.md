# Healthcare-Project





This project leverages a comprehensive healthcare dataset to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI, aimed at providing insights into patient demographics, medical conditions, treatment outcomes, and billing information.



The primary objectives of this project are to:

      Analyze patient demographics and medical conditions to identify trends and disparities.
    Assess the impact of admission types on patient outcomes and healthcare costs.
    Evaluate the effectiveness of treatments through medication usage and test results.
    Provide actionable insights for healthcare providers to enhance patient care and optimize resource management.

By visualizing this dataset in Power BI, stakeholders will gain a deeper understanding of patient care dynamics, enhance decision-making capabilities, and ultimately improve healthcare delivery processes. The dashboard will serve as a valuable tool for monitoring performance metrics, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring better health outcomes for patients.
